#  Bash Scripting Project: Automated Backup System

## A. Project Overview

**What does this script do?**  
This is an automated backup system written in **Bash**. It creates compressed backups of any folder, generates SHA256 checksums for data integrity, and verifies them automatically.  
It also supports rotation (deleting old backups), dry-run mode, simulated email notifications, and a restore function.

**Why is it useful?**  
Manual backups are time-consuming and error-prone. This script automates the process safely, ensuring old backups are cleaned and new ones are verified.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## B. How to Use It

### 🔧 Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up and run the Backup Automation System:

### **1️. Clone the Project**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PavanSPK/Automated_Backup_System_Project.git
cd Automated_Backup_System_Project
```

### **2️. Give Execution Permission**
```bash
chmod +x backup.sh
```

### **3️. (IMPORTANT) Set Backup Destination Path**

You must set where backups will be stored.

#### **Option A — Edit `backup.config` (recommended)**
Open file:
```bash
nano backup.config
```

Set path (example WSL path to C Drive project folder):
```
BACKUP_DESTINATION="/mnt/c/Users/hp/Downloads/Automated_Backup_System_Project-main/backups"
```

Save → `Ctrl + O` → `Enter`  
Exit → `Ctrl + X`

---

#### **Option B — Update inside `backup.sh` (if required)**

Search for this line in `backup.sh`:
```bash
BACKUP_DESTINATION="./backups"
```

Replace with(your required path to setup backups):
Example:

```bash
BACKUP_DESTINATION="/mnt/c/Users/hp/Downloads/Automated_Backup_System_Project-main/backups"
```

---

####  Ensure backup folder exists
```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/c/Users/hp/Downloads/Automated_Backup_System_Project-main/backups
```

### **4️. Create Test Data Folder**
```bash
mkdir -p testdata
echo "file1 test content" > testdata/file1.txt
echo "sample file" > testdata/file2.txt
```
---

###  Basic Usage

Backup a folder:
```bash
./backup.sh /path/to/source/folder
```

Dry-run mode (test without creating files):
```bash
./backup.sh --dry-run /path/to/source/folder
```

List existing backups:
```bash
./backup.sh --list
```

Restore a backup:
```bash
./backup.sh --restore backup-2025-11-06-0441.tar --to /path/to/restore
```

### ⚙️ All Command Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `--dry-run` | Shows what the script *would* do without making changes |
| `--list` | Lists all backups in the destination folder |
| `--restore` | Restores a given backup to a specified folder |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## C. How It Works

###  Rotation Algorithm
The script keeps a limited number of **daily, weekly, and monthly** backups based on configurable values.  
Example:
- Keep last **7 daily**, **4 weekly**, and **3 monthly** backups.  
Older backups are deleted automatically.

###  Checksums
Each backup file gets a SHA256 checksum file (e.g. `backup.tar.gz.sha256`) to verify data integrity using:

```bash
sha256sum -c backup.tar.gz.sha256
```

##  Folder Structure Example

```
Bash_Scripting_Project:Automated_Backup_System/
├──backup.sh               # Main backup automation script
├──backup.config           # Configuration file
├──backup.log              # Log file recording all backup activities
├──README.md               # Markdown file with detailed project explanation
│
├── test_folder/                # Additional folder for testing multi-sourcebackups
│   ├──README.md                # Markdown file with detailed testing examples with screenshots

```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## D. Design Decisions

- **Locking**: Prevents multiple script runs at once using `/tmp/backup.lock`.
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Helps safely test the process.
- **Logging**: All actions are logged to `backup.log`.
- **Error Handling**: Handles folder missing, low space, permission errors, and interruptions.
- **Simulated Email**: Writes a summary email to `email.txt` after backup.

**Challenges Faced:**
- Handling edge cases like interrupted backups.
- Managing safe cleanup and old backup deletion.

**Solutions:**
- Used Bash error handling (`set -euo pipefail`).
- Added cleanup and verification after backup creation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## E. Testing

### Steps Performed:
1. Created test folders and sample files.
2. Executed backup normally.
3. Verified checksum manually.
4. Tested restore and dry-run.
5. Simulated low disk space and missing folders for error handling.

### Example Output:
```
[2025-11-03 11:27:29] Creating backup: backup-2025-11-04-1127.tar.gz
[2025-11-03 11:27:29] SUCCESS Backup created: backup-2025-11-04-1127.tar.gz
[2025-11-03 11:27:29] Checksum created: backup-2025-11-04-1127.tar.gz.sha256
[2025-11-03 11:27:29] Verification SUCCESS: backup-2025-11-04-1127.tar.gz
[2025-11-03 11:27:29] Cleaning old backups...
[2025-11-03 11:27:29] Deleted old backup: backup-2025-11-04-1032.tar.gz
[2025-11-03 11:27:29] Simulated email written to: /mnt/c/Users/hp/Documents/bash_projects/backups/email.txt
[2025-11-04 11:27:29] INFO Script finished
```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## F. Known Limitations

- No real email sending — only simulated.
- Works best on Linux/WSL (Windows CMD/PowerShell may behave differently).
- Rotation is time-based, not size-based.
- Does not support incremental or differential backups (only full).

### Improvements:

- Add real email alerts.
- Support incremental backups.
- Add encryption and cloud upload.
- Improve logs and CLI options.
